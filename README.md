#### Tasks
##### 28 May 2022
```
- read: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08582.pdf
- understand the data (what interests us is: "utt" and "intent")
- analyze the models from: https://github.com/alexa/massive (massive/src/massive/models/)
- read about HerBERT and other models for Polish Language Understanding (https://github.com/ksopyla/awesome-nlp-polish#polish-transformer-models)
- search for similar work in the domain of Polish language (we need examples, can be other slavic languages but Polish is what we're looking for in the first place)
- load HerBERT (example is on the HerBERT related website) and run it on some example sentences
```

##### 31 May 2022
